Double-click on the file named 'TTTGame.exe' to launch the program.

The first player, Token 'X', will then be prompted to enter two values. The first value 0-2 will determine which row the token will be placed in, and the second value 0-2 will determine which column the token will be placed in. Enter a value for the row, press space, enter a value for the column, then press enter.

The program will then display the updated state of the board with the token that was just placed.

The second player, Token 'O', will then be prompted to take their turn in the same way that player one did.

Play continues until there either a winner or a draw.

The console will print out the winner or it will print 'Tie game' in the event of a tie.
